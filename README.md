# Mutual Funds Capital Gains
This aim of this project is to calculate number of units required to sell a Equity Mutual Fund so that LTCG(Long-term capital gains) is tax Free

For Equity Mutual funds the gains up to 100,000 INR is tax free in a Financial Year. To calculate number of units required to sell a MF scheme so that LTCG is tax free is a complicated process which involves multiple factors such as
1. LTCG is applicable for any unit purchased before one year of selling date
2. LTCG up to 100,000 INR is tax free while above this amount is taxable at 10% 
3. However, the LTCG made till 31 January 2018, have been grandfathered, so the gains will remain tax-exempt.
4. If you have a SIP spanning across multiple years then each cost and sale price has to be calculated individually
