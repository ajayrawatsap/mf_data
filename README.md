# Mutual Funds Capital Gains
This aim of this project is to calculate the Tax Free LTCG(Long-term capital gains) on Equity Mutual Funds  using Consolidated Account Statement issuued by CAMS.

For Equity Mutual funds the gains upto 100,000 INR is tax free in a Financial Year. To calculate number of units required to sell a MF cheme so that LTCG is tax free is a complcated process which invoves multiple factors such as
1. LTCG is applciable for any unit purchased before one year of selling date
2. LTCG upto 100,000 INR is tax free while above this amount is taxable at 10% 
3. However, the LTCG made till 31 January, 2018, have been grandfathered, so the gains will remain tax-exempt.
